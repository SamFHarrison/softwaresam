# Welcome to `SoftwareSam.tech`

This is technically v2 of my website, v1 is still live on the `www.softwaresam.tech` domain while I develop v2 on this repo.

## Getting started with the repo

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
