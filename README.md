# Welcome to my personal site

## History

This will be the second personal site I make. My first site I made with vanilla HTML, CSS and JS back in 2022, before I even became a professional software developer, and hosted it for a while on the `softwaresam.tech` domain. I don't host the site anymore but you can run it locally from the [repo](https://github.com/SamFHarrison/softwaresam.tech) if you want to see it.

## New Design

This will be my first time using and learning the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework and CI/CD pipleine.

## Getting started with the repo

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
